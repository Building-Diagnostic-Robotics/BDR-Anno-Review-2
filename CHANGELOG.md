# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Expanded view manifest schema and Rust engine manifest models to include structured `inputs`, `render`, and `projection` metadata with explicit required-field validation, including MP4 frame-source variant support and schema-version expectation checks in unit tests.
- Clarified the MVP input contract across architecture and contributor docs: COCO `instances_default.json` + MP4 is primary/preferred, with frames-directory support documented as secondary/optional convenience.
- Updated GitHub Actions CI to install required Linux GTK/GLib/WebKit system packages before Rust checks so Tauri-linked crates can compile on ubuntu runners.

### Added
- Initial architecture-aligned repository scaffold for frontend, Tauri host, Rust crates, schemas, fixtures, CI, and utility scripts.
- Core project documents (`README.md`, docs contribution guide, schema and fixture readmes).
- Safety-focused `.gitignore` rules for datasets, media, secrets, and session artifacts.
